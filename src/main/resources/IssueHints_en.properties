ambiguous_custom_block_signature=Names for custom blocks are non-unique. Two custom blocks with the same name can only be distinguished if they have a different number or order of parameters. Try to make names for custom blocks always unique.
ambiguous_parameter_name_unused=The parameter names in custom blocks do not have to be unique. Never use two or more parameters with the same name in one custom block.
ambiguous_parameter_name_used=The parameter names in custom blocks do not have to be unique. Never use two or more parameters with the same name in one custom block.
call_without_definition=The custom block you refer to does not exist. Maybe you deleted it before.
comparing_literals=Reporter blocks are used to evaluate the truth value of certain expressions. If you compare these two literals, the result will always be the same: %TRUEFALSE. The blocks in the control body will be executed always or never. Therefore comparison is not necessary.
custom_block_with_forever=If a custom block contains a forever loop and the custom block is used in the middle of another script, the script will never be able to finish. The forever loop in the custom block cannot be left, resulting in the calling script never being able to proceed.
custom_block_with_termination=If a custom block contains a Stop all or Delete this clone and the custom block is called in the middle of another script, the script will never reach the blocks following the call.
dead_code=Your project contains dead code. That means, there are blocks which will never be executed.
duplicate_sprite=Your project contains multiple exact copies of the same sprite. Consider using cloning instead.
double_if=Your project contains a duplicated if-condition. You could shorten the program by merging the two if-statements in a single conditional statement.
duplicated_script=Your project contains the identical script twice. You probably only need one of them, and could delete all copies.
empty_control_body=The body of a control structure is empty, so when the control block is invoked, nothing happens.
empty_custom_block=You created a custom block which contains no statements. When the custom block is invoked, nothing happens.
empty_project=Your project is completely empty.
empty_script=You use an empty event block. When the event occurs, nothing will happen.
empty_sprite=The sprite %SPRITE contains no blocks. It will never be part of the game.
endless_recursion=If a custom block calls itself inside its body (or a the message is sent in the same script it was received) and has no condition to stop the recursion, it will run for an indefinite amount of time.
expression_as_touching_or_color=This block expects a colour or a sprite as parameter and does not work correctly with a string or a number.
forever_inside_loop=If two loops are nested and the inner loop is a forever loop, the inner loop will never terminate. Thus the statements preceeding the inner loop are only executed once.
illegal_parameter_refactor=The parameter has the wrong type. By editing the custom block the boolean parameter was made into a number or text parameter. To fix this undo the editing.
long_script=The script you created is very long. Please divide it into two or more smaller scripts to keep track of it.
message_never_received=When a sprite sends a message, you have to take care, that another sprite receives it.
message_never_sent=When a sprite waits for a message to receive, you have to take care, that another sprite sends it.
middle_man=Using a broadcast receiver only to send a broadcast again is considered a code smell, as the script is a middle man between the original sender and the final receiver. Consider to change the message of the final receiver to the message sent of the first broadcast and then delete the middle man to save redundant code.
missing_ask=Your project uses the 'answer' block, but the 'ask' block is never used in the project.
missing_backdrop_switch=If the 'When backdrop switches to' block is used to start a script and the backdrop never switches to the selected one, the script is never executed.
missing_clone_call=If the 'When I start as a clone' block is used to start a script, but the sprite is never cloned, the event will never be triggered and the script will not be executed.
missing_clone_initialization=When a sprite creates a clone of itself but has no scripts started by 'When I start as a clone' or 'When this sprite clicked' events, clones will not perform any actions.
missing_erase_all=If a sprite uses a pen down block but never an erase all block, then all drawings from a previous execution remain for the next run too.
missing_initialization=A variable or attribute in your sprite is not initalized. It will use whatever value it contained at the end of the last run.
missing_loop_sensing=Your script should execute actions when an event occurs. You have to check for this event continuously inside a loop for not missing the event.
missing_pen_down=You use the 'pen down' block but you never lift the pen again, so your sprite will draw forever.
missing_pen_up=You use the 'pen up' block but your sprite has never set the pen down before.
missing_resource=Your program is missing the sound or picture you're trying to use. Select another sound ot image or add the one you intend to use.
missing_termination=The repeat until blocks require a stopping condition. If the condition is missing, the result is an infinite loop. This will then prevent the execution of blocks following the loop in the script.
missing_wait_condition=The wait until blocks require a condition. If the condition is missing, the block will wait forever and the following code is never executed.
multiple_attribute_modifications=There are multiple changes to the same variable or attribute in sequence, which could be replaced by a single statement.
nested_loops=If two or more loops are nested, there often occur some unpredictable problems.
no_working_scripts=If a sequence of blocks does not start with an event block, it can never be executed.
orphaned_parameter=If you delete a created parameter again, be sure to remove it from all the locations, where you used it before.
parameter_out_of_scope=Make sure, that you use the parameters of a custom block only inside of this block.
position_equals_check=When an equals comparison is used as check for an until loop or a wait until, it can occur that the condition is never met exactly. Therefore use '<' or '>' for the comparison.
recursive_cloning=Scripts starting with 'When I start as a clone' should not create clones of itself. This could be result in an infinite number of clones.
same_variable_different_sprite=Make sure, that you use unique names for your variables.
sequential_actions=Your script contains a sequence of repeated similar statements, which could be shortened by using a loop.
sprite_naming=The sprite doesn't have a meaningful name.
stuttering_movement=When you use the 'When key pressed' event for movement, this could result in stuttering movement.
terminated_loop=The loop is terminated before it actually repeats (e.g. by a stop-block).
type_error=Some of the comparisons compare attributes of different types.
unused_custom_block=You created a custom block but you never use it in your project.
unused_parameter=You created a parameter but you never use it in your procedure.
unused_variables=You created a variable but you never use it in your project.
variable_as_literal=You are using the name of a variable as text. Did you mean to use the variable block instead?
variable_initialization_race=A variable is initialized in different scripts triggered by the same event. The result may change depending on the order in which the scripts are executed. Try assigning the values in only one of the scripts.
